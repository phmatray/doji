# Morning Star Doji Pattern

The Morning Doji Star candlestick pattern is a favorite among pattern traders. Not to be confused with the similar Morning Star pattern, this three candle pattern formation is a bullish reversal pattern with a solid history of performing well.

Like the Morning Star pattern, the first candle is a large full bodied bearish candle.

The second candle is a Doji candlestick that gaps down below the body of the first candle.

The third and final candle is a large bullish candle that should gap up and close at least into the halfway point of the first candleâ€™s body. If the third candle completely engulfs the first candle then it is still a valid Morning Doji Star pattern signal.

The Morning Doji Star candlestick pattern is very reliable with a 76% accuracy rate, but it can be hard to find on larger time frames. Use volume and divergence indicators to find clues on if this pattern will turn into a breakout.

Also keep in mind that taller candles tend to outperform their smaller counterparts.
