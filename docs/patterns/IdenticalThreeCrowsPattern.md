# Identical Three Crows Pattern

The Identical 3 Crows candlestick pattern is a three-candle bearish reversal pattern signifying a change in trend.

This candlestick pattern is made up of three full-bodied bearish candles, each opening near the previous candles close and then forming a lower close.

According to Bulkowski’s testing, the Identical Three Crows pattern acts as a bearish reversal pattern 79% of the time, and ranks in 4th place out of 103 candlestick patterns in terms of accuracy. The problem lies in the fact that it’s rare to come across an Identical 3 Crows pattern, and so it has a frequency rating of 83, which is not so great.

With this said, because of its rarity, the statistical accuracy of the Identical Three Crows pattern is questionable. But this pattern’s strength lies in the simple fact that if three consecutive full-bodied candles appear in a trend, bearish candles no less, then it’s fairly safe to assume that a switch in trend is occurring.
